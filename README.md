## Contributing
Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Developer note
The `collection.json` file is generated by a script provided by apple. In case any packages are added or removed you need go generate a new file.

In order to generate the file you need:
- At least Swift 5.4 installed on your machine
- git installed in your machine
- A github personal accesstoken
- [Download the code][package-collection-generator-sourcecode] from github, choose the latest release-branch
- Open terminal and navigate to source code root

Once the above steps have been completed you run the following command from a terminal (provided you change [PATH TO] and [YOUR TOKEN])
```
swift run package-collection-generate [PATH TO]/spm-daisy-collection/packages.json [PATH TO]/spm-daisy-collection/collection.json --auth-token=[YOUR TOKEN]
```

> At the moment of the 5.5 release you'll get an error for the spm-ms-cognitive-services. Just ignore it, we need apple to patch the script to get it working.

More information on how to use the script is available in the official [Package collection generator readme][package-collection-generator-readme]
